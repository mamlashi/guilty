business relation. However, many of them simply do not wish to deal with me because they do not like any trouble and wish to operate their business smoothly. I do not blame them at all and I wish the same. Everyone has a right to live and earn their living peacefully. But the reason of heartache is only because I have lost my right to live a peaceful life and earn my living without distress. 
It is sad to mention, that this has not stopped even after I recently moved to North Rocks (6 years ago). The vigil started again and my closest neighbour was assigned the duty. Every Step in and out from home was watched. One out of many such occasions, when I came home from a meeting, I saw a van waiting right in front of my house. I quietly parked behind it and waited inside the car to see what they were up to. They probably had realised that I would not come out of the car and thus drove off. 
As an innocent man, I believe, I should be able to live happily and peacefully in the country that I chose to spend the rest of life. Despite the continued harassment and attempts to tarnish my reputation, limiting my opportunities at work breaches of privacy, I shall continue to love and be faithful to this nation. However I have vowed to continue this fight for justice for as long as it takes. So that in future any innocent person will not suffer injustice.
