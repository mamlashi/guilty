(addresses no.1 and no. 4) belonging to immigrants with teenage children. These young people were coerced into working in surveillance (as a 'watchdog') for the government, something I have not seen happening in any other country. 
I have been surprised to see that misleading and damaging information about me had gone to the databases of various government and private businesses like Commonwealth Bank. ANZ etc.  
Limiting opportunities at work was evident everywhere and everyone I worked for. During 1999, I worked to sell products for commissions for a company named Sidam. A lady and a man came there too and spoke to the manager. Few days later I was told that if I didn’t meet certain target sales, I could go. I can confidently say that the lady came there was the same who used to observe me when I lived in Epping.  
I saw the extent of this action in the year 2000 when a girt aged approximately 15 years was made to follow and observe my actions with a male companion. This girl was acting under the Iranian government and the Australian government, and had been abused and let by the systems. Today, this girl has a young daughter of her own, and I wonder what her damaged mother going to teach her.
