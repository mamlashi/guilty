 To Whom It May Concern

I wish to make a formal complaint in relation to the actions and events that I have endured by government organisations over the past 20 years since my arrival in Australia from Iran. Within this open letter I have documented what I believe to be several occasions that prove my allegations. 
This open letter is written to you with due respect to the authority, as a concerned and a good samaritan. It is a complaint and an explanation about the situation of migrants like me who have come to this country, who believe in peace and nonviolence. There must be many others like me who are silently suffering and suffocating. As a duty of a citizen of this country I would like to tell you about what I have seen and experienced in this period of twenty years. 
My belief was that this land protects its citizen’s identity, dignity, credibility and honour, that it would not allow anyone to encroach on their citizen’s basic freedom of everyday life.
