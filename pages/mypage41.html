leave my country and migrate to a foreign land was indeed a painful decision to make.
I retrospect I feel that even the period of my association with the Government had amounted to doing injustice to my county. For this I owe an apology to the people of my native land.
The urge to prove myself that I cannot be a traitor to my own country and my own people I made up my mind to search for peaceful existence. That is how I migrated to Australia. Ironically, to my surprise I found that Australia is too willing to do the “dirty job” of the Iranian Government in this country. (The phrase that was used by the Green Party recently while condemning the attitude of the Australian Government towards the refugee immigrants. Unfortunately the Australian Government is contemplating handing back the refugee immigrants to Iran.)
I am still trying to figure out why I am being denied the basic civil rights that the Australian Constitution guarantees to all its citizen. Since I am a legitimate citizen of the country and strongly feel part of it, the Government has a moral obligation to protect me from injustices done by evil forces. I expect the Government of Australia not to be indifferent to any violation of human rights perpetrated
