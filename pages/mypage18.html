Exactly what is seen in countries like Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Africa etc. where the leaders are acting for the interest of the other countries, not their own people. The Russian KGB has entered the Iranian Regime and started its operation of monitoring and defaming the true nationalists. They have established many places to give lectures through the clergies to brainwash the general public and teach them Islam the way they want and not the way the Koran wants, unfortunately due to the lack of knowledge in the country, many people have been affected by it. However the new generation is putting themselves away from it and trying their best to clear the path. The same people who have been brain washed are here in this country and they are using some of the migrants who are innocent are going to their arms because of the social pressure put by the government here. These innocent people can be misused by them for any purposes. I have seen it through my own eyes, many young people who could be well educated to serve this nation skillfully and intellectually for the next generation have been exploited by them.
