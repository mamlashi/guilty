Kindly permit me to narrate here the problems that were responsible for devastating my career and driving me to the brink of despair since I settled down in this country as a citizen. From 1995 the happiness that the gesture brought me then turned into a nightmare once I started settling down to new environment and living conditions in Australia. Within four months of our landing is Sydney I realized that I was being targeted for persecution by the Iranian mercenaries for reason beat known to them.
I hail from a very respectable family and I have lived all life with a sense of dignity and public goodwill. Discipline formed an integral part of my life. During my service in government I was highly regarded for my sense of commitment to work and honesty. All those around me always looked up to me for the values I cherished in life. Now I suddenly find myself as a victim of humiliation inflicted by people who have no respect for human dignity.
