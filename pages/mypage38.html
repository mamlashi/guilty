young Iranian students have been executed by the government run by Ali Khameneai, with the support of the clergy Mr. Janti. For example, just last week five students were executed without a trial, merely for being vocal in their opposition. At the same time, Mr. Janti happily declared that the government "should execute more people so we don't have any problems in future." Having travelled to India many times over the last few decades, I have found it difficult to conduct business, or even just visiting my relatives without interference and harassment, which has been organized by the Iranian Government. How long will this treatment continue? Are you still the same nation who are the proud bearers of independence, freedom and human rights? If someone were to ask Mahatma Ghandi, Nelson Mandela or Jawaharlal Nehru about India's relationship and support of the Iranian Government, would they approve? Putting people such as myself on a 'black list' has no effect on my beliefs and philosophy, but it is the next generation that will pass judgement on your actions.
